Python Project 
Secret Messages (Cryptography) Program

Introduction

In the digital era, safeguarding privacy and security is paramount. To address this need, we've developed the Secret Messages program. This innovative tool utilizes advanced encryption and decryption techniques to protect sensitive information, including messages, images, and electronic transactions, from unauthorized access or tampering on the internet. Encryption, the cornerstone of data security, employs sophisticated ciphers and unique keys to transform readable data (plain text) into an unintelligible format (ciphertext). Secret Messages employs the renowned Caesar and Affine ciphers, ensuring robust encryption and decryption capabilities for user-entered text.

Features

Design and Implementation Highlights
Feature 1: Seamless Execution
The program boasts seamless execution, allowing users to run it repeatedly according to their needs. Users have the flexibility to halt the program at any point by entering '-1'.
Feature 2: Infinite Key Selection
Offering an infinite array of keys, the program empowers users to select any desired numeric value for encryption, enhancing flexibility and security.
Feature 3: Robust Error Handling
Comprehensive error-handling mechanisms ensure a smooth user experience by adeptly addressing all potential errors encountered during program usage.
Feature 4: Intuitive Guidance
Each input prompt within the program is accompanied by clear, concise instructions, guiding users through the encryption and decryption processes effortlessly.

Challenges Overcome

Feature 1: Affine Cipher Validation
In the Affine cipher, users are required to select odd numbers exclusively. Our implementation includes intelligent validation to notify users promptly if an even number is chosen, preserving the integrity of encryption operations.

Ideas for Future Development

Additional Features and Design Enhancements
Feature 1: Expanded Encryption Methods
Future iterations of the program will introduce a diverse range of encryption methods, broadening language support to encompass languages such as Arabic and beyond.
